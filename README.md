## Analysis & Results
   - Results 
       - How is the district summary affected?
           - The district summary is affected because the clean version fo the data takes out the 461 9th graders from Thomas High              School which affect the averages as well as the percentages. In this case, each of the percentages drops as a result              of the changes. 

    
    
## Summary
The four changes that occured to the updated school district analysis begin with each of the three percentages calculated: % Passing Math, % Passing Reading, and % Overall Passing. Each of these saw a decrease of around 0.1%, which is pretty interesting considering the only real other change came from a less than 0.1 decrease in the math score. The reading score stayed pretty much the same, around 81.9, along with the other vairable staying the exact same.
